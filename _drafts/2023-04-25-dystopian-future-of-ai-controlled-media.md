As AI capabilities increase and the requirements to generate output decreases, it seems only natural that certain future media outlets will generate content on the fly instead of skimming though a pool of already existing content. This will allow for more precise tailored stream of preferred content.

On the one hand, one could think of a richer entertainment experience when playing video games. Instead of static storyboards with a few, also static, switchable storylines, the characters, environments, stories get configured and expanded ad hoc. Rogue-like squared by instant feedback integration.

On the other hand, entertainment bleeds into the domain of systems which should be intended to transport quality information. Signals which have the potential to transform the reality-model of the receiver by being different from noise and truthy. But the incentives given by some of those information systems lead to the optimization of the wrong target functions.
