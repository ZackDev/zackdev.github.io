title: collection of weatherstations measuring surface temperature

Trying to render roughly 28,000 stations with Highcharts didn't perform very well on my end here. On the other hand, customer PCs now ship with up to 128 cores? Why invest in code optimization then, just spray the problem with CPUs.

But the rendering thing was not the primary objective here, only a nice-to-have feature, allowing the user to click on a specific station to see the individual mean temperature anomaly.
