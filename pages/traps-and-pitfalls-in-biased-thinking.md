A bias is a preconceived way of thinking that affects our everyday life. Not implicitly faulty, because biases strengthen group cohesion and have a stabilizing effect on our inner world, they have a great amount of influence on how we act. Let's have a look at some biases.

# Confirmation Bias:
> The tendency to seek for information that corresponds with our acquired mindset.

This bias is responsible for filter bubbles. One looks for information that confirms his or her views on a specific topic. Contradicting information gets rejected blindly, almost automatically.

# Hindsight Bias:
> The rationalization of an event after it occurred.

An indication for this bias is when one experiences *I've known it before*, but didn't act on it. Maybe there was conflicting information, that made it unclear or too risky to adjust to it. The rationalization's direction is backwards.

# Repetition Bias:
> Projecting past experiences into the future.

One way to avoid possible negative events or repeat possible positive events in the future by generalizing the outcome of past events.

# Group-think Bias:
> Goes along with the confirmation bias, it applies to one's group.

A bias dominated by group cohesion. To operate successfully as a group, there needs to be a cohesion in the form of shared values and goals. But this can also inevitably lead to it's demise when an individual of the group holds back critical information in favor of the integrity of the group.

# Authority Bias:
> The alignment of one's way of thinking with that of the authority.

Herein lies a tendency to trust information that is presented by an authority more than that of an actor with less authority. If the authority over-arches into other domains, or the authority becomes corrupt, the bias leads to faulty decisions.

Though one may be convinced that his or her decision making process is purely rational, biases distort thinking. By being aware of those biases, one maintains his ability of critical thinking.
