A bias is a preconceived way of thinking that affects our everyday life. Not implicitly faulty, because biases strengthen group cohesion and have a stabilizing effect on our inner world, they have a great amount of influence on how we act in the world. Let's have a look at some biases.

# Confirmation Bias:
The tendency to seek for information that corresponds with our acquired mindset.

# Hindsight Bias:
The rationalization of an event after it occurred.

# Repetition Bias:
Projecting past experiences into the future.

# Group-think Bias:
Goes along with the confirmation bias, it applies to one's group.

# Authority Bias:
The alignment of one's way of thinking with that of the authority.

Though one may be convinced that their decision making process is purely rational, biases distort thinking. By being aware of those biases, one maintains his ability of critical thinking.

See [Wikipedia List Of Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) for a more exhaustive list of biases.
