The following chart uses [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to display the total number (blue line) of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases for Germany. The daily increase (black bars) shows the day to day increase in cases.
{% include corona.html %}
The total daily cases in the chart comes from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) repository. The day to day increase in cases is a calculation on that data.
