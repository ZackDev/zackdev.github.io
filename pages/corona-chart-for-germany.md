The following chart uses [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to display the total number (blue line) of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases for Germany. The daily increase (black bars) shows the day to day increase in cases.

The second chart is showing the weekly performed tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The displayed data lags behind two days, because they get officially published on the week's following Wednesdays.

The total daily cases in the first chart is taken from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) repository. The day to day increase in cases is a calculation on that data.
The second chart's data comes from [RKI - Situations Report](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Sept_2020/2020-09-09-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile).
