The human web of knowledge is filled with probable solutions to Fermi's Paradox. Distilled into the following phrases it goes like this:

> Given the vastness of space, why haven't we encountered any aliens yet?

There are many ways we're looking for signs of alien life. One of them is the *SETI* project (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), which scans regions of the sky for unnatural radio-signals.

Let's assume that there are extraterrestrial species that have figured out that we are here. Would aliens show themselves to us? Our home galaxy, the *Milky Way* is between 150.000 and 200.000 light-years in diameter. Like we are not on the edge of the galaxy, we assume too that the *others* also are not at the opposite edge. Generously halving the distance to 75.000 light-years, a *expeditionary fleet* cruising at light-speed would, well, take 75.000 years to arrive here.

Would it be wise to investigate a signal that is 75.000 years old? The chances are high that the discovered civilization has gone extinct while traveling there. The closest star system is around 4.5 light-years away.

In my opinion, the search for artificial signals should be restricted to our close neighborhood where we can expect a response in a reasonable amount of time.
