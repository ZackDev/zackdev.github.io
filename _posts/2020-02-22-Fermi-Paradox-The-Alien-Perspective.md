The human web of knowledge is filled with probable solutions to Fermi's Paradox. Distilled into the following phrases it goes like this:

> Given the vastness of space, why haven't we encountered any aliens yet?

There are many ways we're looking for signs of alien life. One of them is the *SETI* project (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), which scans regions of the sky for unnatural radio-signals.

Another stunning method, not exactly for finding *intelligent* life, but detecting life is as follows: during the transition of a planet in front of it's host star, there is a narrow window where one can observe the light that traveled through the planet's atmosphere. By analyzing the light's spectrum it is possible to determine the atmosphere's *composition* and further derive which processes happen on that planet.

Let's assume that there are extraterrestrial species with their own version of *SETI* that have figured out that we are here. Would aliens show themselves to us? Our home galaxy, the *Milky Way* is between 150.000 and 200.000 light-years in diameter. Like *we* are not on the edge of the galaxy, we assume too that the *others* also are not at the opposite edge. Generously halving the distance to 75.000 light-years, radio-signals as well as a *expeditionary fleet* cruising at light-speed would, well, take 75.000 years to arrive here.

Given the time that it takes to get here, would it be wise to investigate the source of a signal that is 75.000 years old by going there? Asides from such a striking discovery, chances are high that our civilization has gone extinct and their artifacts withered away while traveling there.

In my opinion, the search for artificial signals should be restricted to our galactic neighborhood where we can expect a response in a reasonable amount of time.
