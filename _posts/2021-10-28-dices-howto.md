The [Dices UI]({% post_url 2021-10-28-roll-some-dices %}) consists of six elements, which are described below in order of appearance.

# Settings
<img src="/assets/icons/audio-enabled.svg" style="height:20px;width:20px"/> Turn audio on/off.

# Dice Sets
Available sets of dices are listed here. Select a set of dices by clicking on it. Doing so changes the available types of dices presented in the next element.

# <img src="/assets/icons/newdice.svg" style="height:20px;width:20px"/> - A row containing types of dices.
Here you can see the available types of dices. Click on an existing type (e.g. D6) to create a new dice and put it into the bucket. Clicking in the icon to the left opens a form where you can create new types of dices.

# <img src="/assets/icons/bucket.svg" style="height:20px;width:20px"/> - The bucket.
Click on the bucket icon to roll the dices. Rolled dices get removed from the bucket and added to the table. Dices can also be removed from the bucket by clicking on the dice.

# <img src="/assets/icons/table.svg" style="height:20px;width:20px"/> - The Table.
The table simply displays the rolled dices with the resulting roll. To clean the table, click the table icon.

# the 'create new dice' element
Is for creating new dices. Here you can specify a name for the new dice and it's sides. Enter a value for name and multiple sides via the `add sides` button. Single sides can be removed by clicking on them. Finally press `create dice` to add a dice type to the list of available dices.
