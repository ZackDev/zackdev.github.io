Entropy is the tendency of unordered states to fall back to their natural state. Imagine an untouched, sandy, salty and sunny beach. This is the natural state, entropy is high. Now you build a sandcastle, you mess with the natural state, making it thereby unordered. Entropy is low. When you leave the beach, assuming no one else is going to expand the sandcastle kingdom, the wind and rain eventually brings back order, increasing entropy again.
