Entropy is the tendency of ordered states to fall back to their unordered state. Imagine an untouched, sandy, salty and sunny beach. This is the unordered state, entropy is high. Now you build a sandcastle, you mess with the unordered state, making it thereby ordered. Entropy is low. When you leave the beach, assuming no one else is going to expand the sandcastle kingdom, the wind and rain eventually tears down the sandcastle, increasing entropy again.
Further, let's assume that all living things tend to lower entropy in the system they act.
- Ant colonies gather resources from their surroundings, thus ordering it.
- An anteater dips into the colony to lower it's own entropy for a step in time.
- Another animal, a jaguar perhaps, preys on the anteater, or in other words uses the ant's and anteater's effort for it's own tendency to order things.
