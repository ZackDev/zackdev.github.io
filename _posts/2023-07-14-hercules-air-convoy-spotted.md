Seeing and hearing five grey painted airplanes flying in a beeline at non-commercial altitude is not an everyday sight around here. The fifth is barely visible at the tip of the convoy.

Those seemed to be **four smaller** and **one bigger** airplane lagging behind at the tail of the convoy, which eventually made it's way to Ramstein airbase.

[https://www.flightradar24.com](https://www.flightradar24.com) clearly shows the beeline, but with one airplane not showing up, all machines being of type [Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-130_Hercules) and [Super Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_C-130J_Super_Hercules), the last one a C-130J-30 with extended fuselage.

# Other than that, the rest is open for pure speculation:

* What did they transport? Troops, supplies, vehicles?
* Why does one not show up at [https://www.flightradar24.com](https://www.flightradar24.com)?
