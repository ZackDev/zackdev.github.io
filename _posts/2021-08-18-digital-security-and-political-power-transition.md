Data is being generated when when using digital services like online shops, travel agencies, social networks. Information, when in the wrong hands, can have serious consequences. Just imagine a data-leak about the next planned vacation. Now back to the real world, where whole governments change.

While the Taliban are taking over power, `Afghans are worried about their digital history`. Data that has been generated in a push for digitization by the local government, including IDs and bio-metric data, is one of high concern along with public available data from social networks.[^1]

In addition, bio-metric scanners used by the U.S. forces to identify their afghan collaborators got in the hands of the Taliban. It is unclear though if this includes the data-bases where the bio-metric data is stored.[^2]

There is a strong possibility that the data is used to identify former collaborators and their peers, putting them at high risk. It would be naive to assume that the Taliban are too backwards to not recognize and not use such data to track and repress those people.

The *Human Rights First* organization has already published a guide on how to possibly bypass, at least making the use of bio-metric recognition systems harder to use.[^3]

# Update 2021-08-18:

The scanners used, can each directly hold up 10,000s of data-sets, with the option to access online data-bases.[^4]
