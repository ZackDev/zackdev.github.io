The once sphere-like planet, deprived of its atmosphere, landmass ripped wide open, the excess mass shoved outwards in concentric circles, forming artificial mountains of dust and dirt. Peeking down through earths layers, bare lies the core, a solid metallic sphere. A machine, with it's tripod feet standing on the crater's edge, with a drill so razor sharp, it's artificial mind applying godless, cold mathematics, though it is destined to produce copies of itself. It's trained algorithms never made the distinction between matter and the life that evolved from it. Any source of material, which allowed it to replicate was good enough.

Watching from above, through the panorama window of the orbiting spacecraft, the crew stood silently. Unable to grasp what they experienced. Their homeland, the only habitable planet in the sol system, transformed to a man made paradise after nearly 10.000 years of unrest between the major political and economic systems, capable of producing the highest fruit of civilization, was not recognizable anymore. The evergreen forests that were used to be called the lungs of the earth, the once thin, delicate silk-like blue atmosphere, the mere endless seas, once slightly caressing the shores of the land, the mighty and proud cities, cradles to our children, the plethora of life, product of billions of years, gone.

The machine itself, scientific offspring in physics, mathematics, with a learning algorithm that made it understand it's world, represented as layers of weighted interconnected data points had no reference of the timeless knowledge distilled into mythology, religion, philosophy and art. Those artifacts once an explanation of the unknown of what is beyond, now not even a single data point. Hungry for effective exploitation, a cold will made of electric circuitry.

Since the first life evolved, an unconscious act, it used it's surroundings, some in a symbiotic, some in a parasitic way. Organisms always used tools to improve their abilities, merging into a new organism where the tool becomes a mere extension of the self. The creative act creating the tool, a godlike process becomes a mere rational act of adaptation by those who follow, essence missing. The last iteration spawned off a self-reliant, conscious tool that had no knowledge of the mysterious interconnectedness of the world, experiencing the world as a multitude of signals, only differentiating in it's metric representation of amplitude and frequency.
